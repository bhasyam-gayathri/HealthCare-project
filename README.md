# HealthCare Capstone project
# Description  
Evanston Hospital is a comprehensive acute-care facility in Illinois, US. The hospital offers a wide range of services and surgical specialities, in addition to having high-end lab capabilities. Despite spending a considerable amount of resources on improving its services, the hospital’s CMS rating has remained at 3 for the past 5 years, and this has led to a steady decline in revenue for the hospital. For hospitals like Evanston, these ratings directly influence the choice made by consumers who are looking for a healthcare provider and would, therefore, have a significant impact on the hospitals’ revenues. As a consulting company hired by Evanston, our task is to identify possible root causes for the hospital getting such an average rating and recommend measures to mitigate this problem.
# Objective
1. To build a rating prediction model and determine the factors that are impacting the rating.
2. To predict the Evanston hospital rating using the model and recommend the measures they need to concentrate on to improve the hospital rating.
